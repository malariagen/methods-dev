If the maintain_element_grouping option is set to 1 (default), then all files produced by a dataelement in the source will be grouped into a dataelement. Otherwise, each source file will be it's own dataelement. The filter option is a string of the form 'metadata_key#regex'; multiple filters can be separated by commas (and neither the keys nor regexs can include hashes or commas). If the filter_after_grouping option is set (the default), grouping based on metadata will be performed first and then the filter applied with it only being necessary for one file in the group to pass the filter by having metadata matching the regex. If the filter_after_grouping option is not set, only files which match the regex will be included and grouped based on their metadata.)\n",
